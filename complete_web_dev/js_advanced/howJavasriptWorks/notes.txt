How Javascript works
//
Javascript engine
    - memory heap
        - allocate memory; ex. const a = 1;
        - memory leak
            - global memory
            - unused memories taking up spaces 
    - call stack
        - ex. console.log('1');
        - what reads and excutes the scripts

//
Javascripts is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking.
- first in last out
- one threaded
    - one thing at a time
- syncrones programmming
    - one thing at a time
- stack overflow
    "
    function foo() {
        foo()
    }
    "
    - infinity recursion causes the overflow


    foo()

//
Javascript Run-Time Environment
    - call stack
    - web api
    - callback queue
    - event loop

//
synchronous vs asynchronous
